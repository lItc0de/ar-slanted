1. Online content and offers

The author assumes no legal responsibility for the timeliness, correctness or completeness of the content presented. Material or non-material claims against the author, resulting out of the usage or non-usage of the presented information or the use of faulty and incomplete information, are categorically barred, provided that there is no clear and proven evidence of intent or wanton negligence incriminating the author. All offers are subject to change without notice and nonbinding. The author reserves the right to change, add to, delete or stop publication of both parts and the entirety of the offer without notice, either for a limited amount of time or indefinitely, as he/she wishes or deems necessary.

2. References and Links

The author is not liable for claims pertaining to direct or indirect references or “hyperlinks” to external web pages, which lie outside of the authors responsibility, unless the author is aware of the contents at the time of referencing the website and if it is technologically possible and reasonable to prevent the use thereof if illegal content is present. The author hereby declares that no illegal content was discernible on the referenced webpage at the time the hyperlink was placed. The author has no influence whatsoever on the current and future design, content or ownership of the linked content or webpage. Because of this the author distances himself/herself decidedly from content of any and all websites, which was changed after the time of the hyperlink placement. This disclaimer is valid for all links and references placed on the authors online offer, as well as third-party entries within author-created guest-books, discussion forums, link- or mailing lists, as well as all other forms of database that can be edited by external contributors. Solely the providers of the external websites that are linked to are legally liable for any illegal, faulty or incomplete content presented on the website, and assume legal responsibility for any and all legal claims that may result out of the use or non-use of the content presented. The place where this content was merely linked to without knowledge of its nature does not assume legal responsibility.

3. Copyright and Trademarks

The author endeavors to honor the copyright of the owner(s) of any of the used images, graphics, audio files, video files and texts, and to use images, graphics, audio files, video files and texts that the author already owns or which are license-free. All trademarks and logos named on this website, which might be owned or protected by third parties, underlie the authority of the appropriate trademark- and ownership laws without restrictions. The mere naming of the aforementioned trademarks and logos does not mean that these are not protected by third-party rights. The copyright of all objects created by the author and uploaded to a site remains with the author. The use or reproduction of such graphics, audio files, video files, or texts in other electronic or printed publications is not permitted without the explicit approval of the author.
